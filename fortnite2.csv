The only concern I have is now when I click on connect to my Xbox account it says, “Failure communicating with Epic Games servers. Please try again later,” and once again 45 mins to an hour I try again and STILL pops up, I don’t know if it’s my phone but every thing is up to date and my iPhone is iPhone 8 Plus so it is compatible.

3939648342,Game is nearly ruined,TheSkilledSnake,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id991619400,8.20.0,3,"When I got an iPhone 8 I was really excited thinking that fortnite would run pretty easily, and oh boy was I wrong.  I should be an na west player but na east gives me better ping and FPS.  Even something small but big like for some reason when I go to open a door the doorbell rings instead, and now whoever was in there knows exactly where I am, before I even open the door.  This can cause them to run downstairs and shoot me dead right on the spot.  And don’t even get me started on how the game crashes frequently and I have to restart my phone for it to not crash again, but when i restart I usually load into my first game on about 2 minutes after the bus kicks me off. I feel like I’m a decent player, I just lag out half the time, as in weird teleporting out from something or lagging off a stair I was peeking from.  The game does have some perks, like they’ve really been going to listen to the community lately, which I am VERY thankful for.  One last thing, VAULT THE TURRET.  It is the most annoying thing in the game and the only way to counter is explosives.  Ok that’s all I have to say.",0
3939647335,Why so many updates?!,Dj.Black Keys,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id509740912,8.20.0,2,I literally just updated this app two days ago and now it just booted me off and said I need to update again! Like seriously can you not fix what you need to then release it? I have to sit and wait for half a gig to download and install (and stare at screen while it does it because I can’t go anywhere else or it’ll just pause) just to play again. The updates are one issue and the controls are another. There’s clearly a disadvantage for mobile vs console players and it gets frustrating but I live with it. The updates are really what brought me here. They’re inconsistent and very intrusive. Plan your updates to not be every other day please... meanwhile I’ll wait until the update is actually released on the App Store.,0

3939648342,Game is nearly ruined,TheSkilledSnake,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id991619400,8.20.0,3,"When I got an iPhone 8 I was really excited thinking that fortnite would run pretty easily, and oh boy was I wrong.  I should be an na west player but na east gives me better ping and FPS.  Even something small but big like for some reason when I go to open a door the doorbell rings instead, and now whoever was in there knows exactly where I am, before I even open the door.  This can cause them to run downstairs and shoot me dead right on the spot.  And don’t even get me started on how the game crashes frequently and I have to restart my phone for it to not crash again, but when i restart I usually load into my first game on about 2 minutes after the bus kicks me off. I feel like I’m a decent player, I just lag out half the time, as in weird teleporting out from something or lagging off a stair I was peeking from.  The game does have some perks, like they’ve really been going to listen to the community lately, which I am VERY thankful for.  One last thing, VAULT THE TURRET.  It is the most annoying thing in the game and the only way to counter is explosives.  Ok that’s all I have to say.",0
3939647335,Why so many updates?!,Dj.Black Keys,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id509740912,8.20.0,2,I literally just updated this app two days ago and now it just booted me off and said I need to update again! Like seriously can you not fix what you need to then release it? I have to sit and wait for half a gig to download and install (and stare at screen while it does it because I can’t go anywhere else or it’ll just pause) just to play again. The updates are one issue and the controls are another. There’s clearly a disadvantage for mobile vs console players and it gets frustrating but I live with it. The updates are really what brought me here. They’re inconsistent and very intrusive. Plan your updates to not be every other day please... meanwhile I’ll wait until the update is actually released on the App Store.,0

I think you need to add a little bit of things to mobile. You need to take the switch players out of mobile lobbies, it isn’t fair. Can you please remove auto aim it’s very unfair. And finally for the removing section you need to take out controller support it isn’t fair to the people that can’t afford the controllers, they are very expensive. Please add a setting so you can auto assign weapons to a certain item slot. Me being an OG and playing since season 2 I think you should take my recommendations to thought. Thanks HGONYEA21",0

3939608318,Why I didn’t rate a 5 star,Drippy_boi.J,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id902725847,8.20.0,4,The game would be better if they added back 50 health when you get a kill. Another thing is that they should add back the gold chest. The gold chest helped a lot for noobs and bots (no offense) so they could have a better advantage of getting a win. They should have 50v50 return and have team rumble return. If they add back all that I would have rated this a 5 star but I don’t like the update about 999 mats I like it better when it’s 500 mats so again if they add all that back I would rate it a 5 star but everything else is ok with me!😉,0

1- Frames per second
On a new iPad I have 30 FPS. 30 FPS does not work well with Fortnite and limits his good I can be. When doing 90’s my low frame rate limits my speed.

Though I Love it it’s hard to fight against Nintendo Switch Players who r way better than me. Don’t get me wrong I love the occasional build battles. But some people just destroy mobile players then it forces people to use auto fire and then they kill us with that and there No point of fighting normal Matches which were so fun so instead I play Arena cause I fight people my level. No auto fire. I would Love to see a nerf to auto fire with shot guns  in the future of Fortnite Mobile but other than that it’s worth SO GET THE GAME FORTNITE MOBILE FOR LIFE,0

3939326969,Used to be my favorite game.,benwarkov,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id214662578,8.20.0,3,"This game was great, arguably my favorite game to play both on Xbox and eventually mobile when I started caring less. It started off as an amazing free to play game, primarily for the reason that the developers were willing to listen to the community and implement changes that would benefit the user experience. 
However, I genuinely believe that the game is dying due to the fact that Epic feels the need to continuously change things that would have benefitted the game if left alone. For example, siphon. Gaining health from kills is something that seriously helped the campy/die-in-the-storm nature of the game that angers everyone, and it has been added and taken away from the game twice. 
In addition, there have been many additions to the core game mode that heavily changed the meta. Adding zombies, taking them away, then adding more, then adding mist: all effects that could have served a fun purpose if added as tertiary game modes. Taking a break from this game makes it extremely hard to come back and know how to act in the meta unless you watch constant fortnite streams or YouTube videos (which get really old).

One of which is, if your a mobile player its nearly impossible to even run the game. I have an IPad Pro, and I still lag out sometimes. And I know it’s not my internet because it happens to my friends as well. Another prob is, I recently noticed that Epic combined Switch and Mobile servers. This is a big prob because, well, it’s pretty obvious that most Switch players are better at the game. But other than the largest lag spikes I’ve ever had, i think Epic has done a great job. I like what you’re doing with this game, and keep it up. I have a great time playing when I don’t lag a lot. Please consider this, and thank you for your time. (Great game on other platforms btw)",0
