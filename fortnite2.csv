3939648342,Game is nearly ruined,TheSkilledSnake,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id991619400,8.20.0,3,"When I got an iPhone 8 I was really excited thinking that fortnite would run pretty easily, and oh boy was I wrong.  I should be an na west player but na east gives me better ping and FPS.  Even something small but big like for some reason when I go to open a door the doorbell rings instead, and now whoever was in there knows exactly where I am, before I even open the door.  This can cause them to run downstairs and shoot me dead right on the spot.  And don‚Äôt even get me started on how the game crashes frequently and I have to restart my phone for it to not crash again, but when i restart I usually load into my first game on about 2 minutes after the bus kicks me off. I feel like I‚Äôm a decent player, I just lag out half the time, as in weird teleporting out from something or lagging off a stair I was peeking from.  The game does have some perks, like they‚Äôve really been going to listen to the community lately, which I am VERY thankful for.  One last thing, VAULT THE TURRET.  It is the most annoying thing in the game and the only way to counter is explosives.  Ok that‚Äôs all I have to say.",0
3939647335,Why so many updates?!,Dj.Black Keys,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id509740912,8.20.0,2,I literally just updated this app two days ago and now it just booted me off and said I need to update again! Like seriously can you not fix what you need to then release it? I have to sit and wait for half a gig to download and install (and stare at screen while it does it because I can‚Äôt go anywhere else or it‚Äôll just pause) just to play again. The updates are one issue and the controls are another. There‚Äôs clearly a disadvantage for mobile vs console players and it gets frustrating but I live with it. The updates are really what brought me here. They‚Äôre inconsistent and very intrusive. Plan your updates to not be every other day please... meanwhile I‚Äôll wait until the update is actually released on the App Store.,0

3939648342,Game is nearly ruined,TheSkilledSnake,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id991619400,8.20.0,3,"When I got an iPhone 8 I was really excited thinking that fortnite would run pretty easily, and oh boy was I wrong.  I should be an na west player but na east gives me better ping and FPS.  Even something small but big like for some reason when I go to open a door the doorbell rings instead, and now whoever was in there knows exactly where I am, before I even open the door.  This can cause them to run downstairs and shoot me dead right on the spot.  And don‚Äôt even get me started on how the game crashes frequently and I have to restart my phone for it to not crash again, but when i restart I usually load into my first game on about 2 minutes after the bus kicks me off. I feel like I‚Äôm a decent player, I just lag out half the time, as in weird teleporting out from something or lagging off a stair I was peeking from.  The game does have some perks, like they‚Äôve really been going to listen to the community lately, which I am VERY thankful for.  One last thing, VAULT THE TURRET.  It is the most annoying thing in the game and the only way to counter is explosives.  Ok that‚Äôs all I have to say.",0

I have to sit and wait for half a gig to download and install (and stare at screen while it does it because I can‚Äôt go anywhere else or it‚Äôll just pause) just to play again. The updates are one issue and the controls are another. There‚Äôs clearly a disadvantage for mobile vs console players and it gets frustrating but I live with it.

Another thing is that they should add back the gold chest. The gold chest helped a lot for noobs and bots (no offense) so they could have a better advantage of getting a win.

3939326969,Used to be my favorite game.,benwarkov,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id214662578,8.20.0,3,"This game was great, arguably my favorite game to play both on Xbox and eventually mobile when I started caring less. It started off as an amazing free to play game, primarily for the reason that the developers were willing to listen to the community and implement changes that would benefit the user experience. 
However, I genuinely believe that the game is dying due to the fact that Epic feels the need to continuously change things that would have benefitted the game if left alone. For example, siphon. Gaining health from kills is something that seriously helped the campy/die-in-the-storm nature of the game that angers everyone, and it has been added and taken away from the game twice. 
In addition, there have been many additions to the core game mode that heavily changed the meta. Adding zombies, taking them away, then adding more, then adding mist: all effects that could have served a fun purpose if added as tertiary game modes. Taking a break from this game makes it extremely hard to come back and know how to act in the meta unless you watch constant fortnite streams or YouTube videos (which get really old).

One of which is, if your a mobile player its nearly impossible to even run the game. I have an IPad Pro, and I still lag out sometimes. And I know it‚Äôs not my internet because it happens to my friends as well. Another prob is, I recently noticed that Epic combined Switch and Mobile servers. This is a big prob because, well, it‚Äôs pretty obvious that most Switch players are better at the game. But other than the largest lag spikes I‚Äôve ever had, i think Epic has done a great job. I like what you‚Äôre doing with this game, and keep it up. I have a great time playing when I don‚Äôt lag a lot. Please consider this, and thank you for your time.

I can tell you‚Äôre trying to get all of your players back but you‚Äôre just making it all worse. This game is terrible now and it‚Äôs not even enjoyable. Something I would love to see come back is the 50 health per elimination and more mats. Also what‚Äôs this glider redeploys in Team Rumble? 

This game was great up until now. Epic, you should really consider doing better. This game is going downhill very fast.",0
