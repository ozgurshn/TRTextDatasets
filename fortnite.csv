KillaJoeKush,1,Epic every single update on fortnite there are consistent problems. My girlfriend is always getting crashed out of a game . Secondly I hate how you guys have Mobile players matched up with Input Block . How do you see that as a fair game it is not they build way to quickly compared to Mobile . Please fix your game . I don’t understand how you guys always have consistent problems with the game ... PLEASE AND THANK YOU

pacioseok,3,I like Fortnite but every time I revive someone I get kicked or build so this a problem and my internet is always connected so I hope you can fix this
TheDaGGer4,5,After I updated Fortnite. I’m not able to hear a thing. I checked to see if my volumes were down but they’re all up😔
issac.24,5,I love it a lot! No blood or anything so it is isn’t that bad it requires skill and other stuff to play I guess... I don’t have much to say about it but it is the best game ever
sjcvdbms,1,fix the mics asap Its boring without them 🤬 im going to get rid of fn if they dont
A0ds,2,Please make it to where people on mobile don’t get into games it’s mobile people who use a controller it’s unfair
coltonnordwall,1,I don’t like having to face fake defaults
xyvonnet,3,whenever I update it crashes right away .
LocOutFelon187,5,You should make fortnite a split screen but other than that fortnite is fine
Mrs. Bayona,1,Always freaking crashing! Stop updating it ! Learn how to fix it EPIC !!!!! No MIC . This game is getting more stupid every update. Smfh!
Gratefulfern640,5,You should fix the lagging and fix the updates being to long and also take out the revolver and pistol 💖
prxmex,1,When I got Fortnite as soon as I logged on it wouldn’t let me play

omar elgadi,5,Please
Bpkillaman,5,"When you are playing and you see the people watching you. It should let you know how many are live watching and when they are watching and not watching. Also it should give the names of people watching and have the ability to express emojis maybe to express how they feel
About certain situations and events through watching."
Jared Oreellana,5,"Hello Epic Games 

    Again, I come to say there is a problem 
So what happened I see that for people who use ACTUAL controls for MOBILE not connected controller or anything like that.
So I’ll telling you that EVERYTHING is Laggy I’m guessing people don’t want to tell you anything of what’s happening but yea that’s the problem it’s laggy the game is laggy so please fix it....

                                  Your Llama friend"
gavylocuras,5,"Eso de quitar la curación por kill fue lo peor que hicieron ya no tengo ganas de jugar, eso de daba dinamismo a las partidas ahora todos mueren temprano que va dañaron el juego no pienso jugar ya me da pereza"
Cp;€$,5,when will it be available for iPhone 6?
Simpsons are cool,5,This game does not have blood it is for ages

TrueAzzFac,1,I never have mats anymore and don’t get rewarded for my kills -Dizzy
the bestis one,5,Pls
Lianne Chen,4,"The reason of why I gave it a 4 stars is because, I'm tired of Fortnite logging me out of matches, and yes I play on mobile, I'm not able to afford console, ps4, etc, but please try your hardest to fix the logging out thing, it's annoying and tiring to me, and also another thing is, have you guys fixed the voice chat for mobile players, because it's harder for us to play without communication and all, and we get there's an issue with it, but I hope you finish fixing it soon, that's all I have to say, and yeah, but one of my ltm game modes are; you should add in a Simon Says ltm, where the person who has a mic can be the Simon, while everyone else has their mics disappeared, if one of them did something wrong; you kill them, and then they could spectate you, anyways, thank you for reading this.
                        Love, Fortnite Mobile Player."
ano bs,1,I cant download it on my iPhone 6
jlakotaj8,3,lately voice chat is been disabled and I thought the recent update would fix it but voice chat has been disabled for over a month now and some players have it back from the recent update but I still don’t have voice chat back!!!
cloud€£¥11,1,I wonder why epic keeps ruining the game everyone liked it when you got health when you eliminated someone but now you get nothing and they added this thing in the game where it’s like a rectangle box and there’s a white and red line and the white line is how high you ping is and the red line is the lag and since they added that in I can’t play without WiFi and I did that cause I wouldn’t lag but now when I lag I can’t play the game so read this and start adding the things the you took out of the game
GHOST. DREW,1,"Out of nowhere Crashes, In the middle of my game during a fight. Really epic?, it happened to me 20 times right after the update. Come on Epic!"
sganshshvwh,1,They took out the mics on mobile and every season it gets even more laggy it was fine until epic trashed everything
LigmaIsNinja,1,Jdydndndjdbdndbd.  Lag      Updates.      Loading tims
GNinja_YT,5,My only issue with Fortnite is when I join the 1st match after starting the game because it freezes in the loading screen.
Trustab1e,3,Apex is the new Fortnite.
manandroc,5,Fortnite is the best game but when I update it a day ago it updates AGAIN.But after all I have a lot of fun with friends.
Brady riverhunter,1,There are people with a higher advantage than regular players they have it better then regular mobile players so people have a harder time you guys should put them in Xbox lobby’s because in my opinion Xbox doesn’t have as much sweats.Or you guys should put them in lower tier console lobby’s. And nerf bunny hops because in the lava mode it will just ruin the game.p.s add stretch Rez to console and mobile :)
its_destiny,5,I love this mobile game it’s the best and you get to play with a list of people and your friends
Mr.Shadow Fan number 1,3,La resolución es mala y para el iPhone XR ya no es lo mismo porque corta la pantalla y antes no

mark daser,1,Fortnite should be available for all devices not hand selected please fix it
mobileistrashforever,1,Why is it going to be mobile Fortnite if everyone uses control for easier wins
4kmj._,2,"I’ve been playing on Fortnite mobile the day I received an invite over a year ago and I’ve came a long way as far as skill wise . But I have been having some issues about my frame rate on my device, it drops suddenly and then suddenly I receive a slightly higher feeling frame rate , possibly even past then what my device can support (20-30FPS)it seems to me my frame rate skips around and doesn’t stay optimized . Sometimes I also suffer a game winning elimination due to the game freezing for up to 1-2.5 seconds . I’d like to know if you all have other players suffering the same problems using the iOS device I phone SE . If so please give this a fix! Thankyou in advance."
What's Up Losers!💩🙊,4,I love this game. It is just soooooo addicting! I recommend this game to anyone who hasn’t tried it. It is so fun! And plus you get to play with your friends! The only bad thing is that I want Fortnite to work with IPOD Touches! PLEASE! I love the game and I would play a lot more only if the creators made Fortnite work with IPOD Touch. I’m begging you! Please!😭
hihihhihihihihihi,5,Because I’ve been waiting for a iphone skin for a Long time and it will be appreciated greatly ty <3

Unknown Baked Potato,5,"Fortnite is awesome and bananas taste better than my baba sitter. Ahem, baba sitter is tastier than bananas."
rhyryh(sy,4,"Fortnite on mobile does not support iPad mini 2’s, Why I don’t know, all i know is i love this game its soo fun and when i saw it came out on mobile i was so happy because i could finally play more, mostly because me and my brother (i am older) have only one PS4 and we have to switch every match and sometimes he complains because he would die immediately or he would rage and not give me the remote then we get into a fight, and then our mom or dad would just take away the remotes and ground us, but thats not the point, the point is i just want to be able go play more so pls Epic Games if your are reading this please try and make it available on iPad mini 2’s and pls give me i response so i know you at least tried

_htx_t_,2,"I don’t know why  the voice chat on mobile doesn’t work, and it really irritates me because I can’t talk with my friends. I tried everything, even contacting epic games but I get no answers pls someone help"
Lillucia08,5,You guys added the xbox controller and i think it would be better if you guys also added the PS4 controller.
princessxxsarah,3,"i’ve been playing fortnite since the release of fortnite mobile. the lag wasn’t bad when it first came out. as the game progressed and new seasons came out the lag got way worse. i play on the newest iphone and the lag shouldn’t be at bad as it is. when i’m in a match i get a little wifi symbol with a red or yellow x and or a yellow arrow. when i’m in a match my game lags so bad where i cant take a step without my game really lagging. if the lag is really bad which most of the time is it, my game crashes. i’ve watched endless videos of how to stop the lag and nothing has worked. please fix this issue."

sksksk its adriana,5,Welp for me I review this as a five but in all I like the game because their are different games to play in fortnight and u can meet or talk to ppl (people).The only thing I don’t like is that their are Child predators on this game.

GBO CookZies_YT,5,Epic I would like you to fix this glitch I’m having lately when I place stairs and then I place a pyramid in front of me and edit it edits the floor it’s also a thing pc do and it works just fine on pc but mobile it does not I really want you to fix like when I build stairs than I place a pyramid in front and than I edit through it edits the stair under it please fix it and also when I edit floors and pyramids on the bottom it edits the floor than i try editing the pyramid and it edits the floor instead fix that please!
swiftyboi05,2,"It annoys me that you have to update it in the App Store, and then update it in the app and it take longer to update. It also won’t update if you have the app closed. It just disables me from playing on mobile when I want to play while I’m out. Please fix this it really annoys me."
sharky123456789 team10 ohio,5,i love Fortnite because they let me play with me dad from far away and they let me talk to my dad to and you can play with friend and your family like me dad
flores_money,1,"This week is the worst update ever you still can chat in your game and when you land it’s a glitch you can't do anything but walk FIX IT. You think you fixing the game or making it better but sometime they don’t do help just make the game worse. Why would you add something that really help the game like the 50 health when killing someone, that everyone got used to and than take it out making it the game worse AGAIN. You trying to make the game good but their is nothing that was fixed when I play today."
fortnitesucks17722894,1,Fortnite is such a bad game so many hackers I have nightmares over it beacause it’s so bad
Vnkhjjhkkjhhbjkkhbj,1,I know this review will be deleted because all my bad reviews do but this game is super buggy between the pick axe not doing damage to anything or vc being disabled for a month because they are brain dead I mean they had a small problem with some people mics mine was fine my friends wasn’t they fixed it and now there all broken I mean there either stupid or don’t care also health/shield per kill was a great idea who ever came up with that deserves a raise because when I land tilted I usually get in 3 fights back to back and and now I always lose I might win the first 2 but when I’m 17 hp no shield there’s not much I can do bring back shield per kill and fire the moron that got rid of it
Kevin was here12093,2,The game would be better if you guys would put the mic on the game back because it would be harder if your playing squads you won’t know where people might be and you won’t know when to push
ShhsjalLuxis,1,To many updates and they take FOREVER!
Radi0_Flyer7,5,"This game is so good, and I definitely want to see what else they put into the game after season 8!! Keep up the good work epic games!"
Oheckyabro,1,I can’t believe they took the materials and health away from kills. Worst thing they’ve ever done. It’s TERRIBLE.
Yisusze,3,Ya lleva como 15 días que el voice chat no funciona y pues está  bien culero no poder mentar madres con tus compas ni tener una mejor táctica por no poder hablar entre nosotros

MissReapin,4,"Needs to fix voice chat, kill/players display, chests near volcano area and friend request. Voice chat hasn’t worked for awhile now. The kills and how many players alive is merged together so it hard to tell how many players are left. Most of the chests around volcano and ship won’t let you open them. The friend request icon disappeared since recent update. Love the game though ❤️"
Just Aydin YT,5,I personally play pc go sub to me at Just aydin On youtube but overall for a mobile game is solid
unkwown person,1,"first of all fix the mobile mikes, you said in the patch notes you were gonna put mobile mikes back for iOS but u didn’t because u don’t like your mobile fans. and also fix my freak8ng lag because lag just ruins everyth8ng and also give other iOS devices better quality so people can enjoy the game more and give iOS more FPS so they could have more fun."
hbfveisbd,1,For Xbox and Nintendo it won’t let me log in
momo👑👑👑,5,"I love this game so much I just think that you should make every person there own creator code or like let them get into games without have the input thing for different devices 
Other whose game is great"
HoagieBun65,4,After the announcement which started the mic on mobile will not be working. After the latest update you states]d that mic on mobile would be back but recent ally I am having trouble communicating and using the mic to talk with  my teammates. Please fix

KingJuan16,1,Don’t get this game it’s the worst and there’s hackers and bugs that make you glitch of the map
Nico00000000000001,3,It’s a very fun game if you play on a fast devise like one of the newer smartphones or an iPad but if you play on an older phone it is too slow and almost unplayable
UrBoiBennn,4,"I’ve had Fortnite on my phone since season 5 and I’ve been playing Fortnite since season 4. I love the game, but I would like to have some other features such as requesting friends to invite you if they have a private lobby or when they have a full party, allowing certain people to join and others for you to invite, glider redeploy in playground instead of gliders, an LTM that has glider redeploy, etc. This would be my favorite game ever if those were to happen. My favorite game right now is ZombsRoyale.io. I recommend playing it because it’s easier and there are not updates every single week."
RubyJawa,2,I can’t do hear or talk to any of my friends like before
iggyis,1,When are mobile mics coming back
KALEBANTSAVAGE,5,"Fortnite, epic games please somehow make the updates to where we don’t have to wait on the same screen all the time, I’m a pro mobile player and I don’t want to sit on my phone that has many messages being sent to me while I’m stuck in a screen. If you go off this screen it will glitch out and bring you back 30 units of the update such as if I was a 230.88 and I click off for  a minute and then it would be way at 199.50 or so . I love the game thought keep up the good work... and also please change the update screens on mobile. Because they are old and watching the pictures of season 2 and 1 and stuff is rlly boring since we are far pass that, no lie I do miss those seasons it’s just that you should make them better... you already have enough control training so it’s fine...the controls are awesome idk what others are talking bout"
Bot*,1,My pump dose 30 damage close range
OrangeLover928,4,"I looooove this game. Just on suggestion: PLEEEEEEAAASE MAKE BASEBALL SKINS! I’m a ball player and would love it!
I hope this will soon be an addition to the game an I think this’ll make a bid difference in the games popularity. THX fur reading! PEEEEEEAAASSSSEE!"
fabuols,5,Fortnite is fun and addicting
Rich_R1ch4rd,5,"Hello, Epic Games. So far I have been enjoying your game that you and your company have established for the world to experience! I just wanted to let you know that you guys are doing a great job! Keep up the good work!👍"
uwususudususu,5,Yes best best best best yes game ever is my brothers love it One of my brothers is 10 and he’s the best at fortnight totally get this game!
djgwitojynklervqjnoferq,5,I love this game is so fun  my fraviote  game mode is creative
Vlonezy,5,I think you guys should make a billy bounce emote with the music for 800 vbucks with the music. Im looking forward to this thanks
Fart out of the anus,5,There is one problem is that when I fart I jump and rpg myself and die
Kabhuahha,4,When are you going to give back mics for mobile
samherb7,5,It’s an amazing game it logs me out every once in a while but the key is to not get stressed and log back on also it’s very fun too play with friends
Five star Jayhawks,1,I can’t sign into my account that I have had since season three with over 110 dollars spent on it. THIS UPDATE IS THE WORST POSSIBLE. Snipers no longer hit at all. Building is no longer a thing. And shotguns don’t work better off playing PUBG where physics of a shooting game work. Fortnite mobile hasn’t been considered improving for ever. EPIC STOP PAYING ATTENTION TO EVERYTHING BESIDES MOBILE. Epic games stop making bad updates for mobile only. THANKS EPIC FOR A BAD GAME
hhhsnaiwndfj,5,This is the best game I have ever played I usually play on pc and it is really fun. I love you Fortnite!!!
virtaul games,4,You should be able to play with the people who have the same type of phone as you because if the people with better phones get better FPS they can shoot faster and play the game easier but we are stuck on 30 FPS
Angie in Cali,5,I love this game
brianna the cat,5,It is gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood!
JLO-05,4,The thing I don’t like is that I want to gift my skins not buy them and have a option to gift them oh and on mobile sometimes when I load to a game it loads but when it’s done I get off at the end of the map VERY END!
LBJ=GOST,3,"I am astonished that epic cannot find a way to improve mobile. They took away voice chat about 2 weeks ago due to stability issues. Well they finally “reactivated” it but when I get on excited to play with my friends on fortnite again, I can’t hear them, and they can’t hear me. I tried editing my audio in settings for fortnite but nothing worked. So even though they said voice chat was back, it really wasn’t. And some of my friends who play on mobile too, experienced this problem as well. Please add voice chat back or I will delete this app and find another game I game can play with my friends on."
nvcgbiuji,5,Best game ever
Tic Toc Furry,5,I think it’s a fun game for kids but sometimes people get angry from dying and say bad things so they’ll get in trouble but the rest is fine
kaiden1223,4,Take Nintendo out the game they are destroying people on iOS
Kalkabutt,4,Love the game but crashes a little to much. Also the getting into the game is a little slow
blibby bobby,4,"If you just got this game don’t play it to much or it will become boring. By the way epic, make every thing back to season 1 plz I would love that"
zainm1020,5,Heeeeeeeereeeeeelllllllllllllll!!!!!!!!!!!!its good
Rese_YT,1,We should have a free starter pack skin for playing Fortnite mobile y’all have one to. Xbox ps4 so don’t you think we should get a skin to like you gave them a skin
nickjonas2034,5,So is someone gunna fix the none mic on mobile players and how much lagging it does
King_Kong132,5,Can you fix the shotguns because every single time I shoot it does like 32 damage on the head. I hit like 22 too. This game is so trash. Why would you release it if it isn’t ready. This game is so trash. Unreleased this game. Fix everything then release it. once again it it trash. I’m quitting.
sosdude,4,Fortnite all night battle royal in the moonlight
that boy geo,5,"Your game is so fun and I just wanted to tell you my friend has been teaming with enemies 
And I want you to banned him please"
Dead Shadow23564665,5,I love it but recency I got a xbox and ether way it is fun if you are traveling  and the controls are not ridiculous hard to handle in all great job and if epic games reads this there is one skin I want it is Black Knight my gamer tag is Circuit37 if I ever see it in my locker I will spread the word Fortnite is the best
alexa urenda,5,The reason this game is good because you could meet people that you don’t even no before but it could  be dangerous but at least your trying something new. The only thing is bad is spending money on v buck which you should of have save the money for college
errdydfh,5,Messssesssss
💎💴💳💵,5,The best game ever I’ve ever played in my life
wow!!!! :/ :(,1,There are too many updates in this game and the worst part is that you need to update it in the App Store then you have to update it in the game!!!!!😡😡😡 And now it won’t let me update it anymore 😡😡😡
scullnight,5,This is a well one of the best games ever better than minctaft
Ninja manic,1,This game I love the game not gonna lie but epic really messed the game up because on our end the game has a lot of bugs and glitches as well that voice chat got disabled it’s been worse because we can’t communicate with our console friends and pc so really this game is in a bad shape right now as well as adding switch players and they calling us easy so I hope epic sees this review and really think how the game is
acutebasilisk88,5,Hey it’s me acutebasilisk88  and I love fortnite but I don’t like how you guys removed getting shield when you kill someone and mobile players have to play with Nintendo switch players and when I want to play on mobile I get killed easily because of the switch players but otherwise I love fortnite. (After a minute) oh and also I dislike how you cannot have the same account on the same console because I broke my switch so now I can’t use my Kingteran account and now I’m V9999999999999 I would love if one day I get my account back on switch.
Rosendo Roybal Jr.,3,The game is alright
jdsjeijd,1,Plz Bring back the shield and mats for kill
davidmhif,5,Give me a skin YouTube channel is davidgamer298 plz sent me a email if you made one
Gonesome,5,Fortnite is a good game.When I play I can meet many friend and talk to them across the world.Fortnite is a good game but there just need to bring the gun that we want back and make more cool skin!I always enjoy playing it but I don’t play that much and hope Fortnite can get more stuff!
SonictheHedgehogFan2004,5,"Really a great adaptation of the game for not-so-wealthy people, the graphics don’t bother me, but every time there’s a new update, I have to reinstall the game, which messes up my controls and stuff. But I have come to live with, it so it’s ok."
Master_Haseeb,5,I have been playing this game for 2 years and it has been the best and I rate it five stars and no bugs at all in this game
Mr beluga whale21,5,This game is better than pubg I use to play it but then me friends told me fortnite is better and IT IS BETTER pubg is a dum rip off of fortnite even though I am a noob I started at season 7 and now it is season 8 but This game is fun and fun to play with my friend sometimes when I play a match iT takes for ever to load but then I check my wifi and then fix it after it works this is a really fun game to play
green$*)(,5,"So I like it but make it easier to build and shoot u have to double tap and dat massed up

And when I fire msg or something I can’t hold I got to double tap!

yhyhuend,3,The controls are not working
Puglover254,5,"This game is probably one of the best games I’ve played so far, but it’s just missing one thing, replays. It’ would be great pretty cool if you added replays. The game is so great, it’s just missing that."
isaacq call me daddy,1,Y’all should add iPhone 6 to play because I have one and it’s so bad y’all should really work on that so y’all should add it on there
puppy lover85,1,Ok stop the bad game
MrTurtleYvNg,5,So Other games on IPhone X or all the way down to iPhone 6 atleast have around medium graphics and I want that on Iphone6s because all I see are big blodges on the map please better graphics
bbbbyghhg,1,Would not recommend downloading until microphones are fixed
babylol1399,1,Ummm I used to always talk to friends and now I can’t it is very boring and a lot of people are quitting this game it starting to succ I spent money on this I WANT A REFUND
sky1dog,5,Yes I was just wondering if the voice chat was fixed for iOS
memphisOSOSIK,5,It’s a great game but the number one problem is on mobile the waiting is so long and they need to add more pictures to the loading screen.
Sodumbjr,5,"Ok first of all I would like to say I love this game. It’s just like on PC and console. But I think the main reason this game on mobile is loved is because they actually have optimizations. A customizable HUD, which Minecraft still doesn’t have, came within a few months. We have footstep indicators which makes up for the terrible audio. They care about us mobile players, and that makes the game special."
Dude62783838,1,"I’m tired of going up against players with pc and controllers. It’s not fair. you should make an option to where we, as the players, are able to enable playing with pc people when we like."
worried cunsumer,3,"Just....no. The servers are broke, the graphics are horrible and the lag is crazy."

hiiguyss,5,"Epic I want to know if you can add the umbrellas to team rumble because in solo,Dous,or squads people get nervous and get win so I hope this helps"
Riverlife2016,4,Optimize the game for phones and try to prevent them from crashing. Overall a fun and addictive game!
F0rtn1t3_4_life,5,"I think fortnite is very addicting, but fun too. I really liked 50V50 because you can get challenges done quickly. I would rather have 50V50 more than team rumble. I also liked it when there was also no glider redeploy because if someone is building up it is annoying when they can just redeploy and fly away. I love the way the animations are and it makes it a little more fun when you are just sitting there and drinking a chug jug. I also like that it is cross platform because I like playing with my friends that play on PS4."
niyelite,5,Really great game and its super good but ya know xbox and ps4 and that stuff is better but mobile is still pretty good and people that can’t build fast on mobile that’s there fault

Adriel8653,4,I like everything in the game but the mic doesn’t work for me so I have to call the person I play with and not use the mic.
a_person_is_here,2,"This game was really fun, until 7.40 to 8.20 is when this game is starting to become hot garbage, I used to get a lot of wins and get some kills, now I just die because of lag, I still like the game but fortnite mobile’s state right now is unplayable whenever I get in a fight I just lag then die, I might switch to console or pc so yeah but if they fix this then I would happily come back and play on Fortnite mobile"

FFORTNITEEEEEE,1,why isn’t allowed on iPhone 6 Plus ? That’s really stupid .
MST_Madz,4,So it’s an amazing game it’s Fortnite in your pocket however the constant updates and crashing is getting really annoying what would be cool if it auto updates so you wouldn’t have to wait all that time for an update and the crashing isn’t so bad but it’s not good either sometimes I would be in a game during a build battle and my game would crash it would be a 5 start review but these are some flaws with Fortnite Mobile
Eva The 3rd,3,I’m always kicked so please try not to make the game lag so much so take out stuff to make it very few.
roblox is the best games ever,5,Is cool
imachickennugget!514,5,I got this game on my phone and I loved it I also have it on my Xbox!it does mess up sometimes  on my phone but its very rare but I absolutely love fortnite and I’m really excited for season 8!!!i also really recommend it and I love how epic games made it for mobile players💕
cat boy 25,4,I wish that there were computer player battle royal because at my house I don’t have good WiFi so myna always lags so I always get creamed and I don’t like it so I wish that that there was computer players in battle royal so could you please make computer players playing against you I know it would be a little easy but I just want it not to be lagging and I don’t have good WiFi because there is a bunch of trees around me so I can’t get good signal at my house and then I could actually get kills and maybe even win maybe just like a mode that’s there for a limited time and if you do it thank you for doing it but there still could be other game modes to
Killa Kam1017,5,You should always love fortnite and not rage when you die don’t be like people’s or thAt don’t dream and just play averyday not saying Ninja and TSM-crew and true  to everybody play sports do something also you should
yEeTyEeT#23,3,I like the game it’s just I hate how it updates every single fricken week and then takes up so much spAcE it’s so fricken annoying so if you guys could cut down the updates I would be real happy. It’s a good game and I really like it but it just causes so much stress when it comes to weekly updates.
Exotic_error,5,So there pros out they use iPads and fight people with legit phones that’s not even a skill gap that’s just completely unfair and another thing is that I lag when on WiFi and when I’m not on WiFi so how can I play clearly when u get this message please text back anyway this game is good keep up the great work

GavinTheabeastThat,5,Daequan I love you
uyuyuuuyyyyy,5,Epic dose of a lot of glitches in season 8 and don’t listen to what the people want epic should listen to people on Twitter instagrams or redit not just ninja and true like bring back double pump or bring back mostly more not add a volcano to the game
withercool,5,I fun have very lot
shut up bob,4,Epic your games are epic but the only thing that’s wrong is my child umm I have not told her the “talk” yet so these big butts are not good for her age so i think you should put a button that makes the butts smaller and normal
Gmaer guy,5,For some reason my mic doesn’t work apart from that it great. Great job epic games
MegaCharizardJ,5,The best game by far

X-dozer man,4,Very slow to get you in a game
khalerajia,4,"Fun and responsive good to get challenges done if you have to go somewhere, my only complaint is you should be able to connect controllers to it easily- and then you should get put with console players so no one can just go destroy all the mobile players with a controller.  Overall a solid fun responsive game I have a iPhone XR so it doesn’t lag that much, does crash sometimes and does use a lot of battery but still pretty fun"

Connerboydude,5,Hey epic you did a great job on your game I is a good kid friendly game but the only think me and my friends really want you to add in the game is that you should allow six people in a one lobby and I know it is confusing because for squads you need four people but when ever we play playground we always 1v1v1v1 and our other friends want to join and we always have to use creative and creative has different maps which is cool but it is really small but in the island where 100 players fight it is way bigger and I know there is a glitch but when we try doing the glitch it doesn’t work so please add six people in a lobby I hope you read this have a good day ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

Other then the crazy start off lag keep up the good work hey no hard pressure epic just putting that out there ."
Cdunc1234,1,You people at epic games are sooooooo dumb. Why would you change that when you kill someone you don’t get shield or health. Vault or nerf the stupid guns like turrets and pumps. And please for the love of god stop adding guns to the game that are trash and nobody will use like the infantry rifle and the flint lock pistol. Also add better shotguns because the tactical shotgun does not do enough damage and the pump does way to much damage!

Dee Bradley Baker,5,"(Not Clickbait) Fortnite Minecraft outfits and emotes were recently added and I had only a few concerns with it. First of all I can’t cuss because my mom checks my phone. Secondly, the author uses hyperbole and dramatic irony to portray theme and mood. Then, when I least expected it he came up to me and asked if I wanted to go to PROM with him and I was all like I already told Michael maybe and I didn’t want to upset him- he knows how to default dance. Finally, American Dad is is superior to to Family Guy because I just like it more well.

somtimes you get bullid,5,Man I don’t know why People say Minecraft is the best game in the world but all you do in Minecraft is build and put on armor it’s boring.but it is fun when you have nothing to do good job epic games  epic games is training you for real life sometimes you get bullied and you have nothing to do about it but this game is helpful I have a kid at my school and I get bullied by him I try to stay away from him as much as I can but he still follows me Once I was in the grass and I was playing with him And all of a sudden he started fighting me and  he  said  get up  and I was on the floor crying  he said get up I thought you were man and there was a yard duty and she did nothing.
Gxlbert,1,"Currently with the v8.11.1 patch the game has lost the siphon effect which would give us 50 shields or health which made the game back to olds state where it just started getting boring, also why remove it because players are “too aggressive” that’s the point of a battle royal to play aggressive. Also let’s not forget about the 40% decrease for gathering materials, it was one of the reasons many people started getting bored of the game but when you (epic games) changed it, it felt like we could actually do good in the game instead of just trying to not get killed because you have less than 100 materials."

2 - Barely any mobile players can win

3 - It’s a huge disadvantage for us mobile players

Please disable the connection between Nintendo and Mobile!"
The_Demon_Lord64,5,Its a good game.I really enjoy playing it and its just a great game.I play it a of the time.
StealthGamerboy,5,Ever since the voice chat enabled for mobile I can’t talk to my friends at all and the storm is so annoying why can’t they slow down the speed and why do they always make every thing strict it’s dumb.
Danny Samano,1,When you start a match you wait for a long time. Also you can’t change gráficos and it is on low and can’t talk on mobile
Yigvyfucyfcifhcfhhvygivvgvj,1,I was enjoying and playing fortnite more then ever before once they switched the mat cap to 500 and added health for kills. I was finally getting to be good at the game and then they ruined it. There was no reason to remove these things. People complaining about good players having to much of a advantage by getting health for killing other players is nonsense. It made the game more fun and just because it was helpful for more experienced players doesn't mean they should remove it. If I am putting my time into this game and now it's going to be that much harder then I don't want to play. Now players can more easily luckily kill me bc if I get into a 3 way fight I won't get my health back for killing one of the other players. It's just stupid. The people putting their time into this game shouldn't be getting screwed over. I'm done with fortnite unless this is changed or a new idea fixes it. And with playground mode and creative there is tons of opportunity for players to get better so if they want to win then just practice. #fortniteisdying
chris_cutedoges,4,I just want a trading system for skins I just want some skins?
Deadshot 1814,4,Great game but starts over when I’m trying to update or it messes up when updating like when it’s on 10 mb then it will go back to 4mb until it goes higher and won’t stop

BRIAIFNWOCNWJRJD,1,Although it could be a fantastic game the controls and the ads are terrible I’d rather play off brand games Battle Royale games than play this. Please fix the controls.

brianna g wagner,3,I love this game but when your on your phone it is to glitch and lags all the time I was playing and landed on a tree and then I kept gliding then it brought me back to the tree then I jumped of and brought me back up
Boo boo blob,5,"I think FORTNITE is fun but I would not suggest this every day because I have experience this from my brother when he has rage quits...so plz don’t do this every day! So now that it’s 2019, I did that one up top was in 2018, any way, it takes really long to get in a game when I haven’t been in it in a week or two. So yah, pretty fun games tho"

Nightstone5,4,Fortnite is amazing it is the only game I can play that has shooting. Ever since Fortnite shut off mobile voice chat (assuming they put it back on) I haven’t been able to hear on speak to anyone. My voice chat is on and full volume. My cousin how is Fortnite master couldn’t even fix it! Help it is so annoying trying to know where to land. Just saying so if you could please fix it that would be great🙏👍. Once again I still love the game more than you could think of😉!
Bradley villa,5,Please epic games why is not anymore like when you kill somebody don’t give you 50 of shield or health 😪😪😪😪😪😪😪

PUGelf,5,This game so awesome i love playing this game but there’s much lag hopefully epic games can fix that
akaalexhatethisgame,5,Epic games come on this update to mobile is bad dog sh**t what is this game sometimes can believe u put Mobile this down making me not wanna play after this update maybe think about us mobile players more bye
Songwriter_4_Life,3,Ya this game is really fun and all but honestly I miss Season 4. When I joined I was super confused but it was fun. I miss the storyline because back then everyone was like what’s going on but now it’s just oh cool another event is happening yay.... :/ I’m just saying that they should up there game. It was so interesting and I played everyday and made sure I got on but now I play at least once a week. I hope they come up with a creative server going back to all the seasons. I just miss the infesting part of the game. This was all my opinion and I’m not trying to offend anyone’s opinion this is my own. Thank you for taking the time to read this. Enjoy your day!
awesomehirl6895,1,I really wish I can play fortnite on my phone but I have an iPhone 6😑
to yfgvvcuj b,5,Thanks epic games
NumberlessD,5,"The game is amazing! Just a few glitches people use to win. Besides that, I’m a mobile player, and I really can’t play because it always takes me back to my home screen in the middle of my final kill, y’know things like that and I would really like it if it got fixed!"
PeacefulDURRR,4,"Great game! Veblen playing since season 4, and started making YouTube content back in season 6. Fortnite mobile is way easier then console or pc because all the tryhards often play those other platforms. The game does have glitches and things that are off, but this game is great, fun, addictive and a great time killer, though I wish they would make undaunted a permanent mode as well as one shot"
Sendit_916,5,This game is so fun just wish it was on phone
nvam killer,5,This game is awesome except for a few lags which are mostly caused by my TERRIBLE WiFi it’s great 5 stars ⭐️

UnicornLife4Ever,5,"Great game, new things everyday in the shop and updates all the time. I love how there are different modes that you can play in Battle Royal, and that those also change almost every week. The only thing that is a little annoying is that the game takes up so much storage on your phone, but that’s reasonable because of how large the game is."
heirnfruidnrhfnrjrnfirnjfbcidd,5,"Man I just want to say I really enjoy dis game but come on mobile has come a longggggg way but can we fix the screen spinning wen editing, lagging, and da jump glitch while joining a game in creative it’s where u can’t fully jump also can we add a gun lock where u cant switch ur guns unless u press the lock button thx btw keep up the good work"
Caden125,5,Omg I love this game it is amazing love the updates!!!!!!
asfghjklojnvdtrwatdiu,5,It is the best game I have ever played it’s even better then Apex Legends
Usmc6333,5,So first of all it crashes a lot when you don’t update you iPad /phone but that’s not to bad because you can just uptake your device another thing is the controls aren’t very good first the reload button should be bigger when I press the reload button sometimes I shoot my gun and I like that’s you can move button around but you should be able to make button bigger and smaller
lit chica,5,To be honest I love this game and when the brought it to mobile I was so happy because I can play on the go.Biulding is way easier so is shooting btw I am a girl gamer🤘🏼🇩🇴🇩🇴❤️❤️ 🎮

Player-673. l,5,"Ok,the graphics are TERRIBLE,I mean like when you’re aiming at someone all you can see are a couple blurs.It’s WAY better on Xbox or PC, literally there’s no such thing as a line in mobile. One time my friends were doing ATV stunts and then the season 7 blizzard came and there skins mashed together. I think there should be Server Glitch Engineers or SGE so they can fix all servers before a massive event would happen so that there aren’t so many glitches. This is my favorite game so I hope EPIC can possibly do this. Thx! 💎🎮💎"
death man 15019,5,I think you guys should have Made where when the ice melted the map flooded and their were boats And sharks
moni 🦊🦁,4,So I love all Fortnights seasons and all but the game takes too long to load unless you have the best WiFi but still after you update the game once you have to do it Again and that is mad annoying to have all your time being wasted on this little game you know it’s bum and time wasting I heard that some people don’t play fortnight because of its problems and that’s all I had to say about this wonderful game and although I bon’t even play it that much I still worry about how much time people have been wasting on this stuff and also I really like the skins but this is some weird stuff that we have no Idea what there doing so yay fortnight may not be the best games to download but still I can be very fun sometimes when you play it and accomplish lots of goals and stuff but  seriously they need to stop doing what every they are so we won’t be so Rood and stuff and this is crazy you no like nothing takes this long to play or even download at all so please stick up for yourself and say something about it and express your feelings and feel comfortable sharing your ideas with us and all your friends and family thank-you.👍
@sonnythe0ne (YouTube&Insta),1,"It would be fun if I could play, hasn’t worked after season 5"
Kearan412_412,5,Awesome
jniouoiji,5,This is a good game like how you use it with mobile and don’t use aim much because it does it for you
Brock.p,4,The game is fun but it get boring because you have the same map I want to season 1 map and skins to come. It would me fun with the old guns map and skins to come back because every one is getting good and there is no way to win for phone players because it is to hard to switch guns. You barley can build that is way you need PS4 to play or pc because it is hard to even move on phone.
whyguyO7,5,"Fortnite is the best game ever, mobile is also super good, works GREAT!"
IanChase007,1,I wrote epic two weeks ago asking why mobile comms aren’t working. No response. Nobody I know playing mobile says their headsets work. We can’t talk to each other. Ruined the experience. I’ll take this review down once they respond.
A-L-E-X 05,2,I think the 8.20 update that released today came with great changes but it also came with unnecessary changes such as the shield per kill in all core game modes this was an unnecessary Chang along with the 50/50/50 mat drop per kill these were very great additions to battle royale and there was no need to change them plz fix this epic(.)
xxXGDEric10Xxx,5,I forgot my login.
Eladio Savage,5,Having fun with defaults
Hsosnsjdusnskosndj,5,People have to understand that this is a game based on multi platforms but put into a mobile lobby they try to fix the game as much and listen to all our suggestions it definitely lags a lot but only when you are using it while in use of something else or if you are in a bad reception area it really is a good game and if you have any problems contact epicgames.com
iwksnjdnindin,4,Season 8 is laging a lot but can you put 60fps in iPad Air 2 thank you but can make mobile not have lags on it all the time thank you
Boston Rae,5,This is mine and my brother’s favorite game it is so fun even my 3 year old nephew plays it and my friends and kids in my class I would recommend this game if you like shooting games or battle royal games it even has save the world witch is a PVP game but no on mobile or switch
TTV Brokenkite,5,"I think that this game is really good with graphics and connection but u wish there was a controller figuration. 
Thanks"
Xz_Why,4,When I download or update the app it sometimes takes more than an hour. If I were Epicgames I would start to shorten the time it takes to load the game before adding an update. But if we put that aside it is an amazing game.
😇😇😇😎😇😇😇,1,Ok so your game Fortnite is making me delete a lot of games on my iPad. I only have like 9 apps yet you ask for more. I’ve paid for stuff on Fortnite. So if this doesn’t stop your I’m going to stop paying for v-bucks. Believe me Fortnite is a really fun game but you want every app to be deleted but Fortnite. Maybe I’m better off playing Apex or PubG.😏
JoseR913,1,The microphones don’t work they have disabled them for 2 weeks now
HPkiller21,3,For me (on a new iPhone 8) voice chat never works. I adjusted the settings with voice chat turned on and I gave fortnite access to my mic in setting but it won’t work. Tell me how to fix it or fix it in game.
Pleeez help,2,"I’ve been using this app since the beta release. At first it wasn’t so bad... but recently there’s an update every day! it wouldn’t be so bad if it wasn’t for the fact that the update itself take 10-15 minutes each time, and then the first game you try to play after the update causes the game to freeze. So you need to close down the app, open it back up, and give an extra 5 minutes to reload. I completely understand this is an extraneous app that requires a lot of power/internet connection from your phone, and an update every few weeks is not a big deal... but having to wait 20 minutes EVERYTIME I open the game is beginning to get infuriating. PLEASE SAVE YOUR UPDATES TO ONCE A WEEK!"
bzbdbxb,5,It has ato much updates and it’s annoying
angelo cajueiro,4,I would like the game to load faster because it takes sooo long to load
...:.:.;....:,5,I’m updating it now I hope y’all fixed the mics
NickSquill,5,I like everything except for the fact that now mobile and switch players got merged. I think it was a terrible idea because the switch players have a way bigger advantage.
Jpzro26,4,The updates or ok but they need to be more like fortnight like when someone is trying to hide in a bush under a tree they go in the bush and get trapped in a rope
ErOros,5,The only problem I have with the game is there are too many buttons and it’s very laggy most games that I play but it’s a really fun game thank u for making fortnite
MunkeyKillerMan,5,Cjdkd
Puunalu,5,Thanks for this fighting game Fortnite can you put Tamato skin and the burger skin to the game because I want to get it I have a lot of v-bucks 26k something so please add them in the item shop thanks🙏🙏your game is better than PUBG!!!
Wood Leroy,2,"The game is fun until the updates are due, then you sitting with the game open for HOURS! If it was once a season it wouldn't be so bad, but updates are constant and you can't play without them. You can't close the app during or you lose all progress. When it's finally all downloaded, burning up half your battery, then it will sit saying ""initializing"" indefinitely. Most downloads/updates take two or three tries before you finally get it to work. Paying for the battle pass didn't help, it fact it got worse. It's really a major turn off."
camcam2483,4,It’s a good app and all but I’m tired of these freakin updates . Soo chilll

Goo slime light saber,5,One of the best games I’ve played. It’s almost too good. It’s so good my phone can’t handle it and it drains my batteries more than any other app. It’s worth it though.

DawsonTBNR,1,Newest update is terrible I can’t get materials anymore I mean it’s annoying  I can’t do anything and I pretty sure most people agree everything that plays fortnite in the sixth grade hates it at my school so please change it back to having 40% more materials in every gamemode pls or otherwise this game is gonna get a lot more hate
Mari_playz,1,There are too many updates .
C1garmonkey007,4,The game is good but there’s a few glitches and stuff to fix and after epic did great they just left like that till there were more glitches And they won’t fix right away they fix glitches right when it happens or at least try too

Candelariasj,5,Fortnite is my favorite game that has came out. But on mobile fortnite starts to lag after 3 games. Also all the try-hards end up getting into my games. Everything is fine about fortnite it’s just the lag and the weekly updates. Fortnite should have every other week updates. Also with the cars Fortnite should add school buses.

flaming torche,2,It’s a good game but the updates are making me upset I updated them three times but it keeps saying I have to update it. So it’s a  a okay game. I’m back from an edit and right now and fornite is making me update it and it’s taking a lot of time right now so I don think you should play this game on mobile
Rameshny,5,I’m just going to say WOW!!!!! This game is so awesome and addictive that I wish I started on season 1. This rate should be “E” instead of “T”. Maybe in season 25 should end and start over because  it collides by John wick and comes back to season 1.
Kyle Milosipher,1,The boy are too hard for Mobile players and should be easy kills
Ahnselmman,5,I hate this game
BVxSmasher,1,Mics doesn’t work it’s not worth downloading
Dsalaz02,1,Seriously ! Over a 2 weeks and the Mics for IOS still haven’t been fixed. Also remove switch players from mobile. Not the same platform! Thus making this game unfair. If it’s not fixed I’m asking Apple / ITunes to refund me all my money spent on Vbucks. 😤
oeyshdixhdhevxhziu82735,5,"This is the absolute best app ever and is so much fun. There is just a few problems. I don’t want to be the Mobil player to complain about losing but the lobbies are a lot harder. I would say I am a decent player and can still get wins not most people with a low win rate makes it that harder. Also is there a way you can get back on an account without the password or email. Other than that it is one of the best games ever. Love you epic and great job.

MassiveMastiff84,5,I don’t even name how to say this but Fortnite is the best but the updates why so long? Can’t you make it any shorter it takes about one to two hours to load in when I update it. That’s the only thing that I have trouble with on this game ever thing else is awesome I really do suggest Fortnite to people who play video games!!❣️❤️
Silverultra1,5,BOI Apex better watch out because this game🔥
cmr123x,5,Pretty good
Elifeiwell,5,I have been playing since the first day moble launched I am pretty good at it.you need good WiFi to pay so I recommend xfinty wifi very stable and good for this game
ttvluckyshots,5,Best game
good but kinda bad,5,The game is good and all but it lags and I hate when that happens but I know that’s its trying to connect to 100 people anyway the game is good awesome and stuff but one thing...it crashes a lot so can you fix that please thanks and great game!
Double HQ,5,It takes a long time for it to download and it takes a lot of Wifi but it’s a AMZING GAME

fluhtrdedfgbhuygvb,4,It ALWAYS updates and I absolutely HATE THAT so yeah but the game is good.
Hehendndn,5,To be completely honest it’s the best game I’ve ever played
Denniseach,4,I like this game because you can have teams and you can battle each other. What I’m not so sure that I like is that people can build on your forts that you make and that you can go throw the walls when you shoot yourself in a cannon other than that it’s pretty good I like play grounds because you find a lot of llamas but sometimes there’s not a lot of good loot in all of them
FrEeLWilly915,1,"This game still crashes, please fix it. I enjoy the concept but it just crashes. My WiFi is is not the problem bc the game runs perfectly fine on pc and on the ps4."
have joy1243 y,5,"This is a great game and I enjoyed it very much. It is a whimsical 3rd person shooter that got me caught on to it. One criticism is that I would limit the lag a little. Every couple of steps I take it lags. Again, great game. Love it."

KennedyCool,4,Why does it have so many updates?
Certified Epic Gamer,5,"I know people are getting mad for building controls or whatever but keep in mind it’s pretty difficult to make a game that was meant for controllers and keyboards go onto mobile.

With that out of the way great game Epic! I’ve played since late S2 and you guys keep getting new ideas every season that make the game better! There is always something you guys do to bring me back, and I don’t know if it’s some sort of game-dev superpower but it definitely works! Plus, you know how to make the community happy and coming back.

TheeLightBearer,3,"UPDATES!!! Jesus it’s like there’s an update for it everyday and it’s not as simple as just updating the app 😒 you need to update the app normally, then open the app and download it AGAIN! THEN you need to install the update! It’s a lot of waiting especially for us working folk who aren’t home or around WiFi all the time. Hell thats the whole point of mobile is for people who aren’t home all the time so how about calm down with the updates? Everyday I get to work an hour early and right now I’m stuck updating it even though I updated two days ago. Good lord. When you’re playing it though it’s flawless and even looks better than the base PS4 and Xbox One versions of the game. Runs even better than the switch version. Amazing mobile port, too many updates."
brockster&1522,5,It is great and can you plz add base ball skins to the game
